# Data-Structures
A Variety of Data Structures implemented in C++. They have been pretty heavily and well tested.
Make sure to also add the contents of the "Include" file at the top of each file so that everything can compile.

## Novel Data Structure: Range Queries in Constant Time
 
This includes a novel data strucuture I invented to answer range queries in constant time, with O(n log n) preprocessing time. It can support any types of queries that a segment tree might.

### Paper
A description can be found in the paper included - it contains background on other approaches such as prefix sums, sparse tables, segment trees, as well as a proof of correctness and complexity for the novel data structure I present at the end.
